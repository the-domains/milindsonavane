# Artistic Development

My secondary education took place in a slightly larger public 
residential school, which was run much in the manner of a military 
school in terms of organization and discipline. However, it also had a 
focused and efficient art division, headed by one extremely creative 
teacher who would make his own shoes, literally, and organize 
competitions for making clay Ganesha idols for annual festivities. This 
was also the time when I got involved seriously with art, giving my 
initial state-sponsored exams that would lead me to graduate in applied 
arts.

The pursuit of higher education brought me to the city of Pune, where I 
would spend the next five years studying for my Bachelor's Degree in 
Applied Arts. The great thing about Abhinav Art College was that despite
different departments, the college ensured that the entire mass of 
students did not work in a department vacuum, and got exposed to each 
other's streams with great effect. This period had a long standing 
impact on my development as an artist-designer.
