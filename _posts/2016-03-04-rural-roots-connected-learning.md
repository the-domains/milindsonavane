# Rural Roots, Connected Learning

I was brought up in Chindavali, a small village of about 800 people on the banks of the Krishna river, about 120 kilometers away from the then expanding urban sprawl of Pune. My parents were both teachers by profession. My mother in particular was responsible for the inception of visual communication in my mind, many years before I came across the term in the modern world. Her teaching methods were unconventional, and involved the use of ever new 'educational toys' crafted from scrap to make sure her students got the point, again well before similar 'modern' teaching methods were introduced in urban Indian schools a good twenty years later. 

The village, even the 1980s, was a close knit and self-sufficient community of farmers and makers, who interacted essentially through barter and exchange of skill. We grew grains on our land in the village, which we exchanged for everything from earthen pots from the village potter, through to ploughing tools for our land which the local carpenter supplied, apart from repairing school desks on the side. It was a community of creators who interacted, communicated and survived by sharing skill. This way of working, this method of creation, would have a major impact on my psyche and world-view in years to come. Here, in closer contact with nature, I was automatically attracted towards how things in nature work. This inquiring attitude has helped me majorly in my progress as a professional, and as an individual attracted towards creating.
