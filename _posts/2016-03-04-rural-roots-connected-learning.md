# Rural Roots, Connected Learning

I was born and brought up in Chindavali, a small village of about 800 
people on the banks of the Krishna river, about 120 kilometres away from
the then expanding urban sprawl of Pune. My parents were both teachers 
by profession. My mother in particular was responsible for the inception
of visual communication in my mind, many years before I came across the
term in the modern world. Her teaching methods were unconventional, and
involved the use of ever new 'educational toys' crafted from scrap to 
make sure her students got the point, again well before similar 'modern'
teaching methods were introduced in urban Indian schools a good twenty 
years later.
