# Professional Endeavours

I felt the impact of a globalized India like never before as soon as I 
stepped into the professional world. If my formative years had given me 
the roots, my professional career gave me the leaves that could breathe 
in the air from around the world. Commercial vocation took me into the 
booming field of Information Technology, where I joined the digital 
industry and worked in different capacities -- from employee to 
entrepreneur -- as a User Interface -- User Experience professional. 
Coming from an arts background had its uses, but the exposure received 
in the digital domain -- phone apps, gaming and software 
applications -- brought me up to speed with where the world was, and 
where it was headed. It is very important for me personally to stay 
connected with the world in this way, through my work.
