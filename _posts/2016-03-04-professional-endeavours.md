# Professional Endeavours

I felt the impact of a globalized India like never before as soon as I stepped into the professional world. If my formative years had given me the roots, my professional career gave me the leaves that could breathe in the air from around the world. Commercial vocation took me into the booming field of Information Technology, where I joined the digital industry and worked in different capacities -- from employee to entrepreneur -- as a User Interface -- User Experience professional. Coming from an arts background had its uses, but the exposure received in the digital domain -- websites, phone apps, gaming and other applications -- brought me up to speed with where the world was, and where it was headed. It is very important for me personally to stay connected with the world in this way, through my work.
