            <title><![CDATA[Rural Roots, Connected Learning]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rural Roots, Connected Learning</h1><p>I was born and brought up in Chindavali, a small village of about 800 people on the banks of the Krishna river, about 120 kilometres away from the then expanding urban sprawl of Pune. My parents were both teachers by profession. My mother in particular was responsible for the inception of visual communication in my mind, many years before I came across the term in the modern world. Her teaching methods were unconventional, and involved the use of ever new ‘educational toys’ crafted from scrap to make sure her students got the point, again well before similar ‘modern’ teaching methods were introduced in urban Indian schools a good twenty years later. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f54d24859741bd77ebfc9728eab0af890353fe0d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
